To connect terraform with our AWS account , we use IAM user

give access
create keys

now download, install aws cli (to store keys of IAM)
check : aws --version

aws configure --profile <profile_name>  (profile name ggives because we can connect multiple account so to identify )
after runing this command 
it will ask for keys
