terraform init  -  initialise terraform download from terraform registry

To connect terraform with our AWS account , we use IAM user
and we use access_key and secret_key

create IAM user
give access
create keys

now download, install aws cli (to store keys of IAM)
check : aws --version

aws configure --profile <profile_name>  (profile name ggives because we can connect multiple account so to identify )
after runing this command 
it will ask for keys, AWS Access Key ID, AWS Secret Access Key, Default region name, Default output format 

if we create new resource 
we write resource block as below

# # Create an EC2 instance
# resource "aws_instance" "example" {
#   ami           = "<ami_name>"
#   instance_type = "<instance_type_name>"
# }

If existing resource
then we write data block


terraform plan  (it will show what was adding newly and deleting )
